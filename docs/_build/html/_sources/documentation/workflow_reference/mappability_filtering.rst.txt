Mappability Filtering
----------------------

*   Uses ``mappability_file`` and ``mappability_threshold`` (float from 0-1) to filter intervals specified by ``interval_file``.
*   Interval files used in Finaletoolkit commands are pre-filtered by mappability quallity to at least the threshold if set.
