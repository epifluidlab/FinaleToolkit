    """
    Takes a BigWig and an interval BED and
    aggregates signal along the intervals with a median filter.

    For aggregating WPS signals, note that the median filter trims the
    ends of each interval by half of the window size of the filter
    while adjusting data. There are two way this can be approached in
    aggregation:

    1. supply an interval file containing smaller intervals. e.g. if
    you used 5kb intervals for WPS and used a median filter window
    of 1kb, supply a BED file with 4kb windows to this function.

    2. provide the size of the median filter window in
    `median_window_size` along with the original intervals. e.g if
    5kb intervals were used for WPS and a 1kb median filter window
    was used, supply the 5kb bed file and median filter window size
    to this function.

    Do not do both of these at once.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_file : str
    interval_file : str
    output_file : str
    median_window_size : int, optional
        default is 0
    mean : bool
        use mean instead
    strand_location : int
        which column (starting at 0) of the interval file contains the
        strand. Default is 5.
    verbose : int or bool, optional
        default is False
