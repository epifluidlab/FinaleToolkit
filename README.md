Some modification to FinaleToolkit are here. 

Please note that the code for delfi, delfi-gc-correct, delfi-merge-bins, and end-motifs still needs to be ported over.

Other than that, the intention for this branch is to optimize user experience, improve code efficiency, and make some fine changes. 

There is no documentation associated with this branch.
